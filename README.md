# JavaGame
A java game did for fun in my second year of computer science studies.
This is a 2D Java game built from scratch with the help of an online tutorial, using only a basic framework found on the internet. The action unfolds in a distorted dimension where time dilates and space contracts, set inside a lecture hall of the Faculty of Automation and Computer Science. Here we follow a second-year student desperately trying to dodge failed exams and survive the semester with as few retakes as possible—ideally none.
